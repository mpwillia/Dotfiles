--- Fast bracket/quote entering ---
Bind ; to skip to first bracket/quote to the left
Ex:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                                       | <- cursor pos
   Pressing ; would move cursor to:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                                 | <- cursor pos 

Ex:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                         | <- cursor pos 
   Pressing ; would move cursor to:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                   | <- cursor pos 



Bind :(Shift-;) to skip to the most nested bracket/quote to the left
Ex:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                                       | <- cursor pos
   Pressing :(Shift-;) would move cursor to:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                         | <- cursor pos 

Ex:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
                         | <- cursor pos
   Pressing :(Shift-;) would move cursor to:
   some text ("foo [hello]", word) and some more stuff
             | <- cursor pos 


Bind ' to skip to first bracket/quote to the right
Bind " to skip to the most nested bracket/quote to the right



--- Jump between blocks ---
Bind one key to jump to the start of the next block below the cursor
Bind one key to jump to the start of the next block above the cursor
